# Fraud Detection Algorithm and Infrastructure

## Purpose

This project implements fraud Detection system is designed to detect fraudulent transactions using a decision tree algorithm. It leverages machine learning techniques to learn patterns and make predictions based on input features. The project provides a complete infrastructure for deploying and running the system, as well as a notification center script for receiving alerts about detected fraudulent transactions. 

## Features

- Decision tree algorithm for fraud detection.
- Kafka integration for data streaming.
- AWS S3 bucket for storing prediction results.
- Python notification center script for receiving fraud alerts.
- Easy-to-use and customizable for different use cases.

## Requirements

To run the Fraud Detection system, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 
- Confluent running on a Docker container preferably
- AWS account for S3 bucket storage of the prediction
